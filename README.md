# Multi-threaded HTTP Server

## Overview

This project involves the development of a multi-threaded HTTP server that integrates functionality from previous assignments, with a focus on concurrency, synchronization, and efficient request handling.

The server can be executed using the following syntax:

[./httpserver [-t threads] <port>]

## Description

The primary challenge of this assignment lay in understanding and applying the core concurrency logic required to build a functional multi-threaded server. Once the design concepts were clearly defined, the implementation became more straightforward.

Collaboration was essential throughout the development processâ€”particularly during the brainstorming and planning phases. Team discussions helped refine the approach and led to more effective solutions.

## Key Concepts

- **Thread-safe queue management** and use of **read-write locks (rwlocks)**
- **Linearization** of concurrent client requests
- **Total ordering** of tasks to maintain consistency
- Design and implementation of a **thread pool** for scalable request handling

## Learning Outcomes

This project provided hands-on experience in building concurrent systems and deepened understanding of:

- Synchronization mechanisms
- Parallel processing
- Systems-level architecture and design
